## **Quick Setup**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Prepare Your Credentials**

Create a `config.py` file in the project folder with your LinkedIn login credentials:

```python
# config.py
email = "your_email@example.com"  # Replace with your LinkedIn email
password = "your_password"        # Replace with your LinkedIn password
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Keep your credentials secure! Avoid sharing or uploading config.py to public repositories.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Chromium Setup (Windows Only)
If Chromium is not already installed, run the following script to set it up:

```python 
python setup.py
```
‚ö†Ô∏è This script only works on Windows as macOS support isn‚Äôt available (can't afford a Mac üòÖ). Please create one for setup.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Script
Once setup is complete, execute the main script:

```python 
python main.py
```

### **Customize Target URL**

The script uses LinkedIn's search filters to focus on specific profiles. To customize this:

1. **Locate the Target URL**:  
   In `main.py`, find the following line:  

   ```python
   target_url = "https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?geoUrn=%5B%22103671728%22%5D&keywords=technical%20recruiter&origin=FACETED_SEARCH&sid=fA%40"

2. **Run**:
